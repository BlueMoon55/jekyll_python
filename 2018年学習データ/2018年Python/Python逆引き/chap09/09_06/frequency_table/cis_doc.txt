Introduction
The CIS Controls™ are a prioritized set of actions that collectively form a defense-in-depth set
of best practices that mitigate the most common attacks against systems and networks. The
CIS Controls are developed by a community of IT experts who apply their first-hand experience
as cyber defenders to create these globally accepted security best practices. The experts who
develop the CIS Controls come from a wide range of sectors including retail, manufacturing,
healthcare, education, government, defense, and others.
We are at a fascinating point in the evolution of what we now call cyber defense. Massive data
losses, theft of intellectual property, credit card breaches, identity theft, threats to our privacy,
denial of service – these have become a way of life for all of us in cyberspace.
And, as defenders we have access to an extraordinary array of security tools and technology,
security standards, training and classes, certifications, vulnerability databases, guidance, best
practices, catalogs of security controls, and countless security checklists, benchmarks, and
recommendations. To help us understand the threat, we’ve seen the emergence of threat
information feeds, reports, tools, alert services, standards, and threat sharing frameworks. To top
it all off, we are surrounded by security requirements, risk management frameworks, compliance
regimes, regulatory mandates, and so forth. There is no shortage of information available to
security practitioners on what they should do to secure their infrastructure.
But all of this technology, information, and oversight has become a veritable “Fog of More” –
competing options, priorities, opinions, and claims that can paralyze or distract an enterprise
from vital action. Business complexity is growing, dependencies are expanding, users are
becoming more mobile, and the threats are evolving. New technology brings us great benefits,
but it also means that our data and applications are now distributed across multiple locations,
many of which are not within our organization’s infrastructure. In this complex, interconnected
world, no enterprise can think of its security as a standalone problem.
So how can we as a community – the community-at-large, as well as within industries, sectors,
partnerships, and coalitions – band together to establish priority of action, support each other,
and keep our knowledge and technology current in the face of a rapidly evolving problem and
an apparently infinite number of possible solutions? What are the most critical areas we need
to address and how should an enterprise take the first step to mature their risk management
program? Rather than chase every new exceptional threat and neglect the fundamentals, how
can we get on track with a roadmap of fundamentals, and guidance to measure and improve?
Which defensive steps have the greatest value?
These are the kinds of issues that led to and now drive the CIS Controls. They started as a grassroots
activity to cut through the “Fog of More” and focus on the most fundamental and valuable
actions that every enterprise should take. And value here is determined by knowledge and data –
the ability to prevent, alert, and respond to the attacks that are plaguing enterprises today.
Led by CIS, the CIS Controls have been matured by an international community of individuals and
institutions that:
• share insight into attacks and attackers, identify root causes, and
translate that into classes of defensive action;
• document stories of adoption and share tools to solve problems;
• track the evolution of threats, the capabilities of adversaries, and
current vectors of intrusions;
• map the CIS Controls to regulatory and compliance frameworks and
bring collective priority and focus to them;
• share tools, working aids, and translations; and
• identify common problems (like initial assessment and
implementation roadmaps) and solve them as a community.
2
These activities ensure that the CIS Controls are not just another list of good things to do, but
a prioritized, highly focused set of actions that have a community support network to make
them implementable, usable, scalable, and compliant with all industry or government security
requirements.
Why the CIS Controls Work: Methodology and Contributors
The CIS Controls are informed by actual attacks and effective defenses and reflect the combined
knowledge of experts from every part of the ecosystem (companies, governments, individuals);
with every role (threat responders and analysts, technologists, vulnerability-finders, tool makers,
solution providers, defenders, users, policy-makers, auditors, etc.); and
within many sectors (government, power, defense, finance, transportation,
academia, consulting, security, IT) who have banded together to create,
adopt, and support the Controls. Top experts from organizations pooled
their extensive first-hand knowledge from defending against actual
cyber-attacks to evolve the consensus list of Controls, representing the
best defensive techniques to prevent or track them. This ensures that the
CIS Controls are the most effective and specific set of technical measures
available to detect, prevent, respond, and mitigate damage from the most
common to the most advanced of those attacks.
The CIS Controls are not limited to blocking the initial compromise of
systems, but also address detecting already-compromised machines
and preventing or disrupting attackers’ follow-on actions. The defenses
identified through these Controls deal with reducing the initial attack
surface by hardening device configurations, identifying compromised
machines to address long-term threats inside an organization’s network,
disrupting attackers’ command-and-control of implanted malicious code,
and establishing an adaptive, continuous defense and response capability
that can be maintained and improved.
The five critical tenets of an effective cyber defense system as reflected in
the CIS Controls are:
Offense informs defense: Use knowledge of actual attacks that have
compromised systems to provide the foundation to continually learn
from these events to build effective, practical defenses. Include only those
Controls that can be shown to stop known real-world attacks.
Prioritization: Invest first in Controls that will provide the greatest risk
reduction and protection against the most dangerous threat actors and
that can be feasibly implemented in your computing environment.
Measurements and Metrics: Establish common metrics to provide a shared
language for executives, IT specialists, auditors, and security officials to
measure the effectiveness of security measures within an organization so
that required adjustments can be identified and implemented quickly.
Continuous diagnostics and mitigation: Carry out continuous
measurement to test and validate the effectiveness of current security
measures and to help drive the priority of next steps.
Automation: Automate defenses so that organizations can achieve reliable,
scalable, and continuous measurements of their adherence to the Controls
and related metrics.

How to Get Started
The CIS Controls are a relatively small number of prioritized, well-vetted, and supported security
actions that organizations can take to assess and improve their current security state. They also
change the discussion from “what should my enterprise do” to “what should we ALL be doing” to
improve security across a broad scale.
But this is not a one-size-fits-all solution, in either content or priority. You must still understand
what is critical to your business, data, systems, networks, and infrastructures, and you must
consider the adversarial actions that could impact your ability to be successful in the business or
operation. Even a relatively small number of Controls cannot be executed all at once, so you will
need to develop a plan for assessment, implementation, and process management.
CIS Controls 1 through 6 are essential to success and should be considered among the very first
things to be done. We refer to these as “Cyber Hygiene” – the basic things that you must do to
create a strong foundation for your defense. This is the approach taken by, for example, the DHS
Continuous Diagnostic and Mitigation (CDM) Program, one of the partners in the CIS Controls.
A similar approach is recommended by our partners in the Australian Signals Directorate (ASD)
with their “Essential Eight” – a well-regarded and demonstrably effective set of cyber defense
actions that map very closely into the CIS Controls. This also closely corresponds to the message
of the US-CERT (Computer Emergency Readiness Team).
This Version of the CIS Controls
With the release of Version 6 of the CIS Controls (in October 2015), we put in place the means to
better understand the needs of adopters, gather ongoing feedback, and understand how the
security industry supports the CIS Controls. We used this to drive the evolution of Version 7, both
in this document and in a complementary set of products from CIS.
In addition to the critical tenets of cyber defense mentioned previously, we also tried to ensure
that every CIS Control is clear, concise, and current. While there’s no magic bullet when defining
security controls, we think this version sets the foundation for much more straightforward and
manageable implementation, measurement, and automation.
At CIS, we listen carefully to all of your feedback and ideas for the CIS Controls. In particular,
many of you have asked for more help with prioritizing and phasing in the CIS Controls for your
cybersecurity program. This topic deserves more thought than we had time for in this Version 7
update, so we’ve decided to address it separately in the near future. We’ll soon be surveying CIS
Controls adopters to better understand your needs in this area. You can also help out by sending
us your feedback and ideas on prioritization now (controlsinfo@cisecurity.org), or by joining the
CIS WorkBench Community (https://workbench.cisecurity.org/communities/71).
We also provide detailed change information to minimize the work for enterprises that choose to
migrate from Version 6 to Version 7.

The true power of the CIS Controls is not about creating the best list of things to do, it’s about
harnessing the experience of a community of individuals and enterprises to make security
improvements through the sharing of ideas, and collective action.
To support this, CIS acts as a catalyst and clearinghouse to help us all learn from each other. Since
Version 6, there has been an explosion of complementary information, products, and services
available from CIS, and from the industry at large. Please contact CIS for the following kinds of
working aids and other support materials:
• Mappings from the Controls to a very wide variety of formal Risk
Management Frameworks (like FISMA, ISO, etc.)

• Information tailored for Small and Medium Enterprises
• Pointers to vendor white papers and other materials that support
the Controls
• Documentation on alignment with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework
Structure of the CIS Controls Document
The presentation of each Control in this document includes the following elements:
• A description of the importance of the Control (Why is This
CIS Control Critical?) in blocking or identifying the presence of
attacks and an explanation of how attackers actively exploit the
absence of this Control.

1 CIS Control 1:
Inventory and Control of Hardware Assets
Actively manage (inventory, track, and correct) all hardware devices on the network so that only
authorized devices are given access, and unauthorized and unmanaged devices are found and
prevented from gaining access.
Why Is This CIS Control Critical?
Attackers, who can be located anywhere in the world, are continuously scanning the address
space of target organizations, waiting for new and possibly unprotected systems to be attached
to the network. They are particularly interested in devices which come and go off of the
enterprise’s network such as laptops or Bring-Your-Own-Devices (BYOD) which might be out
of synch with security updates or might already be compromised. Attacks can take advantage
of new hardware that is installed on the network one evening but not configured and patched
with appropriate security updates until the following day. Even devices that are not visible from
the Internet can be used by attackers who have already gained internal access and are hunting
for internal pivot points or victims. Additional systems that connect to the enterprise’s network
(e.g., demonstration systems, temporary test systems, guest networks) should also be managed
carefully and/or isolated in order to prevent adversarial access from affecting the security of
enterprise operations.
Large, complex enterprises understandably struggle with the challenge of managing intricate,
fast-changing environments. But attackers have shown the ability, patience, and willingness to
“inventory and control” our assets at very large scale in order to support their opportunities.
Managed control of all devices also plays a critical role in planning and executing system backup,
incident response, and recovery.
V7 7
CIS Control 1: Procedures and Tools
This Control requires both technical and procedural actions, united in a process that accounts for
and manages the inventory of hardware and all associated information throughout its life cycle.
It links to business governance by establishing information/asset owners who are responsible
for each component of a business process that includes information, software, and hardware.
Organizations can use large-scale, comprehensive enterprise products to maintain IT asset
inventories. Others use more modest tools to gather the data by sweeping the network, and
manage the results separately in a database.
Maintaining a current and accurate view of IT assets is an ongoing and dynamic process.
Organizations can actively scan on a regular basis, sending a variety of different packet types to
identify devices connected to the network. Before such scanning can take place, organizations
should verify that they have adequate bandwidth for such periodic scans by consulting load
history and capacities for their networks.
In conducting inventory scans, scanning tools could send traditional ping packets (ICMP
Echo Request) looking for ping responses to identify a system at a given IP address. Because
some systems block inbound ping packets, in addition to traditional pings, scanners can also
identify devices on the network using transmission control protocol (TCP) synchronize (SYN) or
acknowledge (ACK) packets. Once they have identified IP addresses of devices on the network,
some scanners provide robust fingerprinting features to determine the operating system type of
the discovered machine.
In addition to active scanning tools that sweep the network, other asset identification tools
passively listen on network interfaces for devices to announce their presence by sending traffic.
Such passive tools can be connected to switch span ports at critical places in the network to
view all data flowing through such switches, maximizing the chance of identifying systems
communicating through those switches.
Many organizations also pull information from network assets such as switches and routers
regarding the machines connected to the network. Using securely authenticated and encrypted
network management protocols, tools can retrieve MAC addresses and other information
from network devices that can be reconciled with the organization’s asset inventory of servers,
workstations, laptops, and other devices. Once MAC addresses are confirmed, switches should
implement 802.1x and NAC to only allow authorized systems that are properly configured to
connect to the network.
Wireless devices (and wired laptops) may periodically join a network and then disappear, making
the inventory of currently available systems very dynamic. Likewise, virtual machines can be
difficult to track in asset inventories when they are shut down or paused. Additionally, remote
machines accessing the network using virtual private network (VPN) technology may appear
on the network for a time, and then be disconnected from it. Whether physical or virtual, each
machine using an IP address should be included in an organization’s asset inventory.

2 CIS Control 2:
Inventory and Control of Software Assets
Actively manage (inventory, track, and correct) all software on the network so that only authorized
software is installed and can execute, and that unauthorized and unmanaged software is found
and prevented from installation or execution.
Why Is This CIS Control Critical?
Attackers continuously scan target organizations looking for vulnerable versions of software
that can be remotely exploited. Some attackers also distribute hostile web pages, document files,
media files, and other content via their own web pages or otherwise trustworthy third-party sites.
When unsuspecting victims access this content with a vulnerable browser or other client-side
program, attackers compromise their machines, often installing backdoor programs and bots that
give the attacker long-term control of the system. Some sophisticated attackers may use zero-day
exploits, which take advantage of previously unknown vulnerabilities for which no patch has yet
been released by the software vendor. Without proper knowledge or control of the software
deployed in an organization, defenders cannot properly secure their assets.
Poorly controlled machines are more likely to be either running software that is unneeded for
business purposes (introducing potential security flaws), or running malware introduced by an
attacker after a system is compromised. Once a single machine has been exploited, attackers
often use it as a staging point for collecting sensitive information from the compromised system
and from other systems connected to it. In addition, compromised machines are used as a
launching point for movement throughout the network and partnering networks. In this way,
attackers may quickly turn one compromised machine into many. Organizations that do not
have complete software inventories are unable to find systems running vulnerable or malicious
software to mitigate problems or root out attackers.
Managed control of all software also plays a critical role in planning and executing system
backup, incident response, and recovery.

Ensure that only software applications or
operating systems currently supported
by the software’s vendor are added to
the organization’s authorized software
inventory. Unsupported software should
be tagged as unsupported in the inventory
system.
Utilize software inventory tools throughout
the organization to automate the
documentation of all software on business
systems.
The software inventory system should track
the name, version, publisher, and install date
for all software, including operating systems
authorized by the organization.
The software inventory system should be
tied into the hardware asset inventory so all
devices and associated software are tracked
from a single location.
Ensure that unauthorized software is either
removed or the inventory is updated in a
timely manner.
Utilize application whitelisting technology
on all assets to ensure that only authorized
software executes and all unauthorized
software is blocked from executing on assets.
The organization’s application whitelisting
software must ensure that only authorized
software libraries (such as *.dll, *.ocx, *.so,
etc.) are allowed to load into a system
process.
The organization’s application whitelisting
software must ensure that only authorized,
digitally signed scripts (such as *.ps1,
*.py, macros, etc.) are allowed to run on a
system.
Physically or logically segregated systems
should be used to isolate and run software
that is required for business operations but
incur higher risk for the organization.
10
CIS Control 2: Procedures and Tools
Whitelisting can be implemented using a combination of commercial whitelisting tools, policies
or application execution tools that come with anti-virus suites and popular operating systems.
Commercial software and asset inventory tools are widely available and in use in many enterprises
today. The best of these tools provide an inventory check of hundreds of common applications
used in enterprises, pulling information about the patch level of each installed program to ensure
that it is the latest version and leveraging standardized application names, such as those found in
the common platform enumeration specification.
Features that implement whitelists are included in many modern endpoint security suites.
Moreover, commercial solutions are increasingly bundling together anti-virus, anti-spyware,
personal firewall, and host-based intrusion detection systems (IDS) and intrusion prevention
systems (IPS), along with application white and black listing. In particular, most endpoint
security solutions can look at the name, file system location, and/or cryptographic hash of
a given executable to determine whether the application should be allowed to run on the
protected machine. The most effective of these tools offer custom whitelists based on executable
path, hash, or regular expression matching. Some even include a gray list function that allows
administrators to define rules for execution of specific programs only by certain users and at
certain times of day.

3 CIS Control 3:
Continuous Vulnerability Management
Continuously acquire, assess, and take action on new information in order to identify
vulnerabilities, remediate, and minimize the window of opportunity for attackers.
Why Is This CIS Control Critical?
Cyber defenders must operate in a constant stream of new information: software updates,
patches, security advisories, threat bulletins, etc. Understanding and managing vulnerabilities has
become a continuous activity, requiring significant time, attention, and resources.
Attackers have access to the same information and can take advantage of gaps between the
appearance of new knowledge and remediation. For example, when researchers report new
vulnerabilities, a race starts among all parties, including: attackers (to “weaponize,” deploy an
attack, exploit), vendors (to develop, deploy patches or signatures and updates), and defenders
(to assess risk, regression-test patches, install).
Organizations that do not scan for vulnerabilities and proactively address discovered flaws face a
significant likelihood of having their computer systems compromised. Defenders face particular
challenges in scaling remediation across an entire enterprise, and prioritizing actions with
conflicting priorities, and sometimes-uncertain side effects.

12
CIS Control 3: Procedures and Tools
A large number of vulnerability scanning tools are available to evaluate the security configuration
of systems. Some enterprises have also found commercial services using remotely managed
scanning appliances to be effective. To help standardize the definitions of discovered
vulnerabilities in multiple departments of an organization or even across organizations, it is
preferable to use vulnerability scanning tools that measure security flaws and map them to
vulnerabilities and issues categorized using one or more of the following industry-recognized
vulnerability, configuration, and platform classification schemes and languages: CVE, CCE, OVAL,
CPE, CVSS, and/or XCCDF.
Advanced vulnerability scanning tools can be configured with user credentials to log in to
scanned systems and perform more comprehensive scans than what can be achieved without
login credentials. The frequency of scanning activities, however, should increase as the diversity
of an organization’s systems increases to account for the varying patch cycles of each vendor.
In addition to the scanning tools that check for vulnerabilities and misconfigurations across the
network, various free and commercial tools can evaluate security settings and configurations
of local machines on which they are installed. Such tools can provide fine-grained insight into
unauthorized changes in configuration or the inadvertent introduction of security weaknesses by
administrators.
Effective organizations link their vulnerability scanners with problem-ticketing systems that
automatically monitor and report progress on fixing problems, and that makes unmitigated
critical vulnerabilities visible to higher levels of management to ensure the problems are solved.
The most effective vulnerability scanning tools compare the results of the current scan with
previous scans to determine how the vulnerabilities in the environment have changed over time.
Security personnel use these features to conduct vulnerability trending from month to month.
As vulnerabilities related to unpatched systems are discovered by scanning tools, security
personnel should determine and document the amount of time that elapses between the public
release of a patch for the system and the occurrence of the vulnerability scan. If this time window
exceeds the organization’s benchmarks for deployment of the given patch’s criticality level,
security personnel should note the delay and determine if a deviation was formally documented
for the system and its patch. If not, the security team should work with management to improve
the patching process.
Additionally, some automated patching tools may not detect or install certain patches due to an
error by the vendor or administrator. Because of this, all patch checks should reconcile system
patches with a list of patches each vendor has announced on its website.

4 CIS Control 4:
Controlled Use of Administrative Privileges
The processes and tools used to track/control/prevent/correct the use, assignment, and
configuration of administrative privileges on computers, networks, and applications.
Why Is This CIS Control Critical?
The misuse of administrative privileges is a primary method for attackers to spread inside a target
enterprise. Two very common attacker techniques take advantage of uncontrolled administrative
privileges. In the first, a workstation user running as a privileged user is fooled into opening a
malicious email attachment, downloading and opening a file from a malicious website, or simply
surfing to a website hosting attacker content that can automatically exploit browsers. The
file or exploit contains executable code that runs on the victim’s machine either automatically
or by tricking the user into executing the attacker’s content. If the victim user’s account has
administrative privileges, the attacker can take over the victim’s machine completely and install
keystroke loggers, sniffers, and remote control software to find administrative passwords and
other sensitive data. Similar attacks occur with email. An administrator inadvertently opens an
email that contains an infected attachment and this is used to obtain a pivot point within the
network that is used to attack other systems.
The second common technique used by attackers is elevation of privileges by guessing or cracking
a password for an administrative user to gain access to a target machine. If administrative
privileges are loosely and widely distributed, or identical to passwords used on less critical
systems, the attacker has a much easier time gaining full control of systems, because there are
many more accounts that can act as avenues for the attacker to compromise administrative
privileges.

CIS Control 4: Procedures and Tools
Built-in operating system features can extract lists of accounts with super-user privileges, both
locally on individual systems and on overall domain controllers. To verify that users with highprivileged
accounts do not use such accounts for day-to-day web surfing and email reading,
security personnel should periodically gather a list of running processes to determine whether
any browsers or email readers are running with high privileges. Such information gathering
can be scripted, with short shell scripts searching for a dozen or more different browsers, email
readers, and document editing programs running with high privileges on machines. Some
legitimate system administration activity may require the execution of such programs over the
short term, but long-term or frequent use of such programs with administrative privileges could
indicate that an administrator is not adhering to this Control.
To enforce the requirement for strong passwords, built-in operating system features for minimum
password length can be configured to prevent users from choosing short passwords. To enforce
password complexity (requiring passwords to be a string of pseudo-random characters), built-in
operating system settings or third-party password complexity enforcement tools can be applied.
Password strength and management (e.g., frequency of change) should be considered in a system
and life-cycle context. An excellent resource is:

Secure Configuration for Hardware and Software
on Mobile Devices, Laptops, Workstations and Servers
Establish, implement, and actively manage (track, report on, correct) the security configuration of
mobile devices, laptops, servers, and workstations using a rigorous configuration management and
change control process in order to prevent attackers from exploiting vulnerable services
and settings.
Why Is This CIS Control Critical?
As delivered by manufacturers and resellers, the default configurations for operating systems
and applications are normally geared towards ease-of-deployment and ease-of-use – not
security. Basic controls, open services and ports, default accounts or passwords, older (vulnerable)
protocols, pre-installation of unneeded software – all can be exploitable in their default state.
Developing configuration settings with good security properties is a complex task beyond the
ability of individual users, requiring analysis of potentially hundreds or thousands of options in
order to make good choices (the Procedures and Tools section on page 17 provides resources for
secure configurations). Even if a strong initial configuration is developed and installed, it must be
continually managed to avoid security “decay” as software is updated or patched, new security
vulnerabilities are reported, and configurations are “tweaked” to allow the installation of new
software or support new operational requirements. If not, attackers will find opportunities to
exploit both network accessible services and client software.

V7 17
CIS Control 5: Procedures and Tools
Rather than start from scratch developing a security baseline for each software system,
organizations should start from publicly developed, vetted, and supported security benchmarks,
security guides, or checklists. Excellent resources include:
• The CIS Benchmarks™ Program (www.cisecurity.org)
• The NIST National Checklist Program (https://nvd.nist.gov/ncp/repository)
Organizations should augment or adjust these baselines to satisfy local policies and requirements,
but deviations and rationale should be documented to facilitate later reviews or audits.
For a complex enterprise, the establishment of a single security baseline configuration (for
example, a single installation image for all workstations across the entire enterprise) is
sometimes not practical or deemed unacceptable. It is likely that you will need to support
different standardized images, based on the proper hardening to address risks and needed
functionality of the intended deployment (for example, a web server in the DMZ versus an email
or other application server in the internal network). The number of variations should be kept
to a minimum in order to better understand and manage the security properties of each, but
organizations then must be prepared to manage multiple baselines.
Commercial and/or free configuration management tools can then be employed to measure
the settings of operating systems and applications of managed machines to look for deviations
from the standard image configurations. Typical configuration management tools use some
combination of an agent installed on each managed system, or agentless inspection of systems
by remotely logging in to each managed machine using administrator credentials. Additionally,
a hybrid approach is sometimes used whereby a remote session is initiated, a temporary or
dynamic agent is deployed on the target system for the scan, and then the agent is removed.

Maintenance, Monitoring and Analysis of Audit Logs
Collect, manage, and analyze audit logs of events that could help detect, understand, or recover
from an attack.
Why Is This CIS Control Critical?
Deficiencies in security logging and analysis allow attackers to hide their location, malicious
software, and activities on victim machines. Even if the victims know that their systems have been
compromised, without protected and complete logging records they are blind to the details of
the attack and to subsequent actions taken by the attackers. Without solid audit logs, an attack
may go unnoticed indefinitely and the particular damages done may be irreversible.
Sometimes logging records are the only evidence of a successful attack. Many organizations keep
audit records for compliance purposes, but attackers rely on the fact that such organizations
rarely look at the audit logs, and they do not know that their systems have been compromised.
Because of poor or nonexistent log analysis processes, attackers sometimes control victim
machines for months or years without anyone in the target organization knowing, even though
the evidence of the attack has been recorded in unexamined log files.

V7 19
CIS Control 6: Procedures and Tools
Most free and commercial operating systems, network services, and firewall technologies offer
logging capabilities. Such logging should be activated, with logs sent to centralized logging
servers. Firewalls, proxies, and remote access systems (VPN, dial-up, etc.) should all be configured
for verbose logging, storing all the information available for logging in the event a follow-up
investigation is required. Furthermore, operating systems, especially those of servers, should
be configured to create access control logs when a user attempts to access resources without
the appropriate privileges. To evaluate whether such logging is in place, an organization should
periodically scan through its logs and compare them with the asset inventory assembled as part
of CIS Control 1 in order to ensure that each managed item actively connected to the network is
periodically generating logs.
Analytical programs such as SIEM solutions for reviewing logs can provide value, but the
capabilities employed to analyze audit logs are quite extensive, even including, importantly, just
a cursory examination by a person. Actual correlation tools can make audit logs far more useful
for subsequent manual inspection. Such tools can be quite helpful in identifying subtle attacks.
However, these tools are neither a panacea nor a replacement for skilled information security
personnel and system administrators. Even with automated log analysis tools, human expertise
and intuition are often required to identify and understand attacks.

Email and Web Browser Protections
Minimize the attack surface and the opportunities for attackers to manipulate human behavior
though their interaction with web browsers and email systems.
Why Is This CIS Control Critical?
Web browsers and email clients are very common points of entry and attack because of their
technical complexity, flexibility, and their direct interaction with users and with the other systems
and websites. Content can be crafted to entice or spoof users into taking actions that greatly
increase risk and allow introduction of malicious code, loss of valuable data, and other attacks.
Since these applications are the main means for users to interact with untrusted environments,
these are potential targets for both code exploitation and social engineering.

CIS Control 7: Procedures and Tools
Web Browser
Cybercriminals can exploit web browsers in multiple different ways. If they have access to exploits
of vulnerable browsers, they can craft malicious web pages that can exploit those vulnerabilities
when browsed by an unpatched browser. Alternatively, if vulnerabilities within the browser are
not available they can try to target any number of common web browser plugins that may allow
them to hook into the browser or even directly into the OS. These plugins, much like any other
application within your environment, need to be managed and controlled, not only to know what
needs to be updated but to also reduce the probability that users unintentially install malware
that might be hiding in some of these plugins and add-ons. Simple configurations of the browser
can make it much harder for malware to get installed by reducing the ability of installing addons/
plugins and also not allowing specific types of content from auto-running.
Most popular browsers employ a database of phishing and/or malware sites to protect against
the most common threats. Make sure that you and your users enable these content filters
and turn on the popup blockers. Popups are not only annoying, they also can host embedded
malware directly or lure users into clicking on something using social engineering tricks. To help
enforce blocking of known malicious domains, also consider subscribing to DNS filtering services
to block attempts to access these websites at the network level.
Email
Email represents one the most interactive ways humans work with computers, encouraging the
right behavior is just as important as the technical settings.
Using a spam-filtering tool reduces the number of malicious emails that come into your network.
Initiating a Doman-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance (DMARC)
process helps reduce spam and phishing activities. Installing an encryption tool to secure email
and communications adds another layer of user and networked based security. In addition to
blocking based on the sender, it is also worthwhile to only allow certain file types that users
need for their jobs. This will require some level of interfacing with different business units to
understand what type of files they receive via email to ensure that there is not an interruption
to their processes.

Malware Defenses
Control the installation, spread, and execution of malicious code at multiple points in the
enterprise, while optimizing the use of automation to enable rapid updating of defense, data
gathering, and corrective action.
Why Is This CIS Control Critical?
Malicious software is an integral and dangerous aspect of internet threats, as it is designed to
attack your systems, devices, and your data. It is fast-moving, fast-changing, and enters through
any number of points like end-user devices, email attachments, web pages, cloud services, user
actions, and removable media. Modern malware is designed to avoid defenses, and attack or
disable them.
Malware defenses must be able to operate in this dynamic environment through large-scale
automation, rapid updating, and integration with processes like incident response. They must
also be deployed at multiple possible points of attack to detect, stop the movement of, or control
the execution of malicious software. Enterprise endpoint security suites provide administrative
features to verify that all defenses are active and current on every managed system.

24
CIS Control 8: Procedures and Tools
To ensure anti-virus signatures are up-to-date, organizations use automation. They use the builtin
administrative features of enterprise endpoint security suites to verify that anti-virus, antispyware,
and host-based IDS features are active on every managed system. They run automated
assessments daily and review the results to find and mitigate systems that have deactivated such
protections, as well as systems that do not have the latest malware definitions.
Being able to block malicious applications is only part of this Control, there is also a big focus on
collecting the logs to help organizations understand what happened within their environment,
and this includes ensuring that there is logging enabled for various command line tools, such as
Microsoft PowerShell and Bash. As malicious actors continue to develop their methodologies,
many are starting to take a “live off the land” approach to minimize the likelihood of being
caught. Enabling logging will make it significantly easier for the organization to follow the events
and how they happened, what happened and how it happened.

Attackers search for remotely accessible network services that are vulnerable to exploitation.
Common examples include poorly configured web servers, mail servers, file and print services,
and Domain Name System (DNS) servers installed by default on a variety of different device types,
often without a business need for the given service. Many software packages automatically
install services and turn them on as part of the installation of the main software package without
informing a user or administrator that the services have been enabled. Attackers scan for such
services and attempt to exploit these services, often attempting to exploit default user IDs and
passwords or widely available exploitation code.

Port scanning tools are used to determine which services are listening on the network for a range
of target systems. In addition to determining which ports are open, effective port scanners can
be configured to identify the version of the protocol and service listening on each discovered
port. This list of services and their versions are compared against an inventory of services required
by the organization for each server and workstation in an asset management system. Recently
added features in these port scanners are being used to determine the changes in services offered
by scanned machines on the network since the previous scan, helping security personnel identify
differences over time.

Secure Configuration for Network Devices,

Establish, implement, and actively manage (track, report on, correct) the security configuration of
network infrastructure devices using a rigorous configuration management and change control
process in order to prevent attackers from exploiting vulnerable services and settings.
Why Is This CIS Control Critical?
As delivered from manufacturers and resellers, the default configurations for network
infrastructure devices are geared for ease-of-deployment and ease-of-use – not security. Open
services and ports, default accounts (including service accounts) or passwords, support for older
(vulnerable) protocols, pre-installation of unneeded software – all can be exploitable in their
default state. The management of the secure configurations for networking devices is not a onetime
event, but a process that involves regularly re-evaluating not only the configuration items
but also the allowed traffic flows. Attackers take advantage of network devices becoming less
securely configured over time as users demand exceptions for specific business needs. Sometimes
the exceptions are deployed and then left undone when they are no longer applicable to the
business needs. In some cases, the security risk of the exception is neither properly analyzed nor
measured against the associated business need and can change over time. Attackers search for
vulnerable default settings, gaps or inconsistencies in firewall rule sets, routers, and switches
and use those holes to penetrate defenses. They exploit flaws in these devices to gain access to
networks, redirect traffic on a network, and intercept information while in transmission. Through
such actions, the attacker gains access to sensitive data, alters important information, or even
uses a compromised machine to pose as another trusted system on the network.

Boundary Defense
Detect/prevent/correct the flow of information transferring networks of different trust levels with
a focus on security-damaging data.
Why Is This CIS Control Critical?
Attackers focus on exploiting systems that they can reach across the internet, including not only
DMZ systems but also workstations and laptop computers that pull content from the Internet
through network boundaries. Threats such as organized crime groups and nation-states use
configuration and architectural weaknesses found on perimeter systems, network devices, and
Internet-accessing client machines to gain initial access into an organization. Then, with a base of
operations on these machines, attackers often pivot to get deeper inside the boundary to steal
or change information or to set up a persistent presence for later attacks against internal hosts.
Additionally, many attacks occur between business partner networks, sometimes referred to as
extranets, as attackers hop from one organization’s network to another, exploiting vulnerable
systems on extranet perimeters.
To control the flow of traffic through network borders and police content by looking for attacks
and evidence of compromised machines, boundary defenses should be multi-layered, relying on
firewalls, proxies, DMZ perimeter networks, and network-based IPS and IDS. It is also critical to
filter both inbound and outbound traffic.
It should be noted that boundary lines between internal and external networks are diminishing
as a result of increased interconnectivity within and between organizations as well as the rapid
rise in deployment of wireless technologies. These blurring lines sometimes allow attackers to
gain access inside networks while bypassing boundary systems. However, even with this blurring
of boundaries, effective security deployments still rely on carefully configured boundary defenses
30
that separate networks with different threat levels, sets of users, data and levels of control.
And despite the blurring of internal and external networks, effective multi-layered defenses of
perimeter networks help lower the number of successful attacks, allowing security personnel to
focus on attackers who have devised methods to bypass boundary restrictions.

CIS Control 12: Procedures and Tools
The boundary defenses included in this Control build on CIS Control 9. The additional
recommendations here focus on improving the overall architecture and implementation of
both Internet and internal network boundary points. Internal network segmentation is central
to this Control because once inside a network, many intruders attempt to target the most
sensitive machines. Usually, internal network protection is not set up to defend against an
internal attacker. Setting up even a basic level of security segmentation across the network and
protecting each segment with a proxy and a firewall will greatly reduce an intruder’s access to the
other parts of the network.
One element of this Control can be implemented using free or commercial IDS and sniffers
to look for attacks from external sources directed at demilitarized zone (DMZ) and internal
systems, as well as attacks originating from internal systems against the DMZ or Internet. Security
personnel should regularly test these sensors by launching vulnerability-scanning tools against
them to verify that the scanner traffic triggers an appropriate alert. The captured packets of the
IDS sensors should be reviewed using an automated script each day to ensure that log volumes
are within expected parameters and that the logs are formatted properly and have not been
corrupted.
Additionally, packet sniffers should be deployed on DMZs to look for Hypertext Transfer Protocol
(HTTP) traffic that bypasses HTTP proxies. By sampling traffic regularly, such as over a three-hour
period once a week, information security personnel can search for HTTP traffic that is neither
sourced by nor destined for a DMZ proxy, implying that the requirement for proxy use is being
bypassed.

Data Protection
The processes and tools used to prevent data exfiltration, mitigate the effects of exfiltrated data,
and ensure the privacy and integrity of sensitive information.
Why Is This CIS Control Critical?
Data resides in many places. Protection of that data is best achieved through the application
of a combination of encryption, integrity protection and data loss prevention techniques. As
organizations continue their move towards cloud computing and mobile access, it is important
that proper care be taken to limit and report on data exfiltration while also mitigating the effects
of data compromise.
Some organizations do not carefully identify and separate their most sensitive and critical
assets from less sensitive, publicly accessible information on their internal networks. In many
environments, internal users have access to all or most of the critical assets. Sensitive assets may
also include systems that provide management and control of physical systems (e.g., SCADA).
Once attackers have penetrated such a network, they can easily find and exfiltrate important
information, cause physical damage, or disrupt operations with little resistance. For example,
in several high-profile breaches over the past two years, attackers were able to gain access to
sensitive data stored on the same servers with the same level of access as far less important data.
There are also examples of using access to the corporate network to gain access to, then control
over, physical assets and cause damage.

34
CIS Control 13: Procedures and Tools
It is important that an organization understand what its sensitive information is, where it resides,
and who needs access to it. To derive sensitivity levels, organizations need to put together a list
of the key types of data and the overall importance to the organization. This analysis would be
used to create an overall data classification scheme for the organization. Organizations should
define labels, such as “Sensitive,” “Business Confidential,” and “Public,” and classify their data
according to those labels. Once the private information has been identified, it can then be further
subdivided based on the impact it would have to the organization if it were compromised.
Once the sensitivity of the data has been identified, create a data inventory or mapping that
identifies business applications and the servers that house those applications. The network then
needs to be segmented so that systems of the same sensitivity level are on the same network and
segmented from systems with different trust levels. If possible, firewalls need to control access to
each segment.
Access to data should be based on job requirements and a need-to-know basis. Job requirements
should be created for each user group to determine what information the group needs access to
in order to perform its jobs. Based on the requirements, access should only be given to the data
segments or servers that are needed for each job function. Detailed logging should be turned on
for servers in order to track access and allow for security personnel to examine incidents in which
data was improperly accessed.

Controlled Access Based on the Need to Know
The processes and tools used to track/control/prevent/correct secure access to critical assets
(e.g., information, resources, systems) according to the formal determination of which persons,
computers, and applications have a need and right to access these critical assets based on an
approved classification.
Why Is This CIS Control Critical?
Encrypting data provides a level of assurance that even if data is compromised, it is impractical to
access the plaintext without significant resources; however, controls should also be put in place
to mitigate the threat of data exfiltration in the first place. Many attacks occurred across the
network, while others involved physical theft of laptops and other equipment holding sensitive
information. Yet, in many cases, the victims were not aware that the sensitive data were leaving
their systems because they were not monitoring data outflows. The movement of data across
network boundaries both electronically and physically must be carefully scrutinized to minimize
its exposure to attackers.
The loss of control over protected or sensitive data by organizations is a serious threat to business
operations and a potential threat to national security. While some data are leaked or lost as a
result of theft or espionage, the vast majority of these problems result from poorly understood
data practices, a lack of effective policy architectures, and user error. Data loss can even occur as
a result of legitimate activities such as e-Discovery during litigation, particularly when records
retention practices are ineffective or nonexistent.
The adoption of data encryption, both in transit and at rest, provides mitigation against data
compromise. This is true if proper care has been taken in the processes and technologies
associated with the encryption operations. An example of this is the management of
cryptographic keys used by the various algorithms that protect data. The process for generation,
use and destruction of keys should be based on proven processes as defined in standards such as
NIST SP 800-57.
Care should also be taken to ensure that products used within an enterprise implement well
known and vetted cryptographic algorithms, as identified by NIST. Re-evaluation of the
algorithms and key sizes used within the enterprise on an annual basis is also recommended to
ensure that organizations are not falling behind in the strength of protection applied to their
data.
For organizations that are moving data to the cloud, it is important to understand the security
controls applied to data in the cloud multi-tenant environment, and determine the best course of
action for application of encryption controls and security of keys. When possible, keys should be
stored within secure containers such as Hardware Security Modules (HSMs).
Data loss prevention (DLP) refers to a comprehensive approach covering people, processes, and
systems that identify, monitor, and protect data in use (e.g., endpoint actions), data in motion
(e.g., network actions), and data at rest (e.g., data storage) through deep content inspection
and with a centralized management framework. Over the last several years, there has been a
noticeable shift in attention and investment from securing the network to securing systems
within the network, and to securing the data itself. DLP controls are based on policy, and include
classifying sensitive data, discovering that data across an enterprise, enforcing controls, and
reporting and auditing to ensure policy compliance.

Wireless Access Control
The processes and tools used to track/control/prevent/correct the security use of wireless local
area networks (WLANs), access points, and wireless client systems.
Why Is This CIS Control Critical?
Major thefts of data have been initiated by attackers who have gained wireless access to
organizations from outside the physical building, bypassing organizations’ security perimeters
by connecting wirelessly to access points inside the organization. Wireless clients accompanying
travelers are infected on a regular basis through remote exploitation while on public wireless
networks found in airports and cafes. Such exploited systems are then used as back doors when
they are reconnected to the network of a target organization. Other organizations have reported
the discovery of unauthorized wireless access points on their networks, planted and sometimes
hidden for unrestricted access to an internal network. Because they do not require direct physical
connections, wireless devices are a convenient vector for attackers to maintain long-term access
into a target environment.

V7 39
CIS Control 15: Procedures and Tools
Effective organizations run commercial wireless scanning, detection, and discovery tools as well as
commercial wireless intrusion detection systems.
Additionally, the security team should periodically capture wireless traffic from within the borders
of a facility and use free and commercial analysis tools to determine whether the wireless traffic
was transmitted using weaker protocols or encryption than the organization mandates. When
devices relying on weak wireless security settings are identified, they should be found within
the organization’s asset inventory and either reconfigured more securely or denied access to the
organization network.
Additionally, the security team should employ remote management tools on the wired network
to pull information about the wireless capabilities and devices connected to managed systems.

Account Monitoring and Control
Actively manage the life cycle of system and application accounts - their creation, use, dormancy,
deletion - in order to minimize opportunities for attackers to leverage them.
Why Is This CIS Control Critical?
Attackers frequently discover and exploit legitimate but inactive user accounts to impersonate
legitimate users, thereby making discovery of attacker behavior difficult for security personnel
watchers. Accounts of contractors and employees who have been terminated and accounts
formerly set up for Red Team testing (but not deleted afterwards) have often been misused
in this way. Additionally, some malicious insiders or former employees have gained access to
accounts left behind in a system long after contract expiration, maintaining their access to an
organization’s computing system and sensitive data for unauthorized and sometimes malicious
purposes.

CIS Control 16: Procedures and Tools
Although most operating systems include capabilities for logging information about account
usage, these features are sometimes disabled by default. Even when such features are present
and active, they often do not provide fine-grained detail about access to the system by default.
Security personnel can configure systems to record more detailed information about account
access, and use home-grown scripts or third-party log analysis tools to analyze this information
and profile user access of various systems.
Accounts must also be tracked very closely. Any account that is dormant must be disabled and
eventually removed from the system. All active accounts must be traced back to authorized users
of the system, and they should utilize multi-factor authentication. Users must also be logged out
of the system after a period of inactivity to minimize the possibility of an attacker using their
system to extract information from the organization.

Special Notation Regarding CIS Controls 17 – 20 for V7
• CIS Control 17: Implement a Security Awareness and Training Program
• CIS Control 18: Application Software Security
• CIS Control 19: Incident Response and Management
• CIS Control 20: Penetration Tests and Red Team Exercises
All of these topics are a critical, foundational part of any cyber defense program, but
they are different in character than CIS Controls 1-16. While they have many technical
elements, these are less focused on technical as controls and more focused on people
and processes. They are pervasive in that they must be considered across the entire
enterprise, and across all of CIS Controls 1-16. Their measurements and metrics of
success are driven more by observations about process steps and outcomes, and less by
technical data gathering. They are also complex topics in their own right, each with an
existing body of literature and guidance.
Therefore we present CIS Controls 17-20 as follows: for each CIS Control, we identify a
small number of elements that we believe are critical to an effective program in each
area. We then describe processes and resources which can be used to develop a more
comprehensive enterprise treatment of each topic. Although there are many excellent
commercial resources available, we provide open and non-profit sources where
possible. The ideas, requirements, and processes expressed in the references are well
supported by the commercial marketplace.

17 CIS Control 17:
Implement a Security Awareness and Training Program
For all functional roles in the organization (prioritizing those mission-critical to the business and
its security), identify the specific knowledge, skills and abilities needed to support defense of
the enterprise; develop and execute an integrated plan to assess, identify gaps, and remediate
through policy, organizational planning, training, and awareness programs.
Why Is This CIS Control Critical?
It is tempting to think of cyber defense primarily as a technical challenge, but the actions of
people also play a critical part in the success or failure of an enterprise. People fulfill important
functions at every stage of system design, implementation, operation, use, and oversight.
Examples include: system developers and programmers (who may not understand the
opportunity to resolve root cause vulnerabilities early in the system life cycle); IT operations
professionals (who may not recognize the security implications of IT artifacts and logs); end users
(who may be susceptible to social engineering schemes such as phishing); security analysts (who
struggle to keep up with an explosion of new information); and executives and system owners
(who struggle to quantify the role that cybersecurity plays in overall operational/mission risk, and
have no reasonable way to make relevant investment decisions).
Attackers are very conscious of these issues and use them to plan their exploitations by, for
example: carefully crafting phishing messages that look like routine and expected traffic to an
unwary user; exploiting the gaps or seams between policy and technology (e.g., policies that have
no technical enforcement); working within the time window of patching or log review; using
nominally non-security-critical systems as jump points or bots.
No cyber defense approach can effectively address cyber risk without a means to address this
fundamental vulnerability. Conversely, empowering people with good cyber defense habits can
significantly increase readiness.

CIS Control 17: Procedures and Resources
An effective enterprise-wide training program should take a holistic approach and consider policy
and technology at the same time as the training of people. Policies should be designed with
technical measurement and enforcement and they should be reinforced by training to fill gaps in
understanding; technical controls can be implemented to protect systems and data and minimize
the opportunity for people to make mistakes. With technical controls in place, training can be
focused concepts and skills that cannot be managed technically.
An effective cyber defense training program is more than an annual event; it is an ongoing
process improvement with the following key elements:
• The training is specific, tailored, and focused based on the specific
behaviors and skills needed by the workforce, depending on their job
role and responsibility.
• The training is repeated periodically, measured and tested for
effectiveness, and updated regularly.
• It will increase awareness and discourage risky work-arounds by including
rationale for good security behaviors and skills.
In the actions called out in this Control, we have identified some critical elements of a successful
training program. For more comprehensive treatment of this topic, we suggest the following

Application Software Security
Manage the security life cycle of all in-house developed and acquired software in order to prevent,
detect, and correct security weaknesses.
Why Is This CIS Control Critical?
Attacks often take advantage of vulnerabilities found in web-based and other application
software. Vulnerabilities can be present for many reasons, including coding mistakes, logic errors,
incomplete requirements, and failure to test for unusual or unexpected conditions. Examples of
specific errors include: the failure to check the size of user input; failure to filter out unneeded
but potentially malicious character sequences from input streams; failure to initialize and clear
variables; and poor memory management allowing flaws in one part of the software to affect
unrelated (and more security critical) portions.
There is a flood of public and private information about such vulnerabilities available to
attackers and defenders alike, as well as a robust marketplace for tools and techniques to allow
“weaponization” of vulnerabilities into exploits. Attackers can inject specific exploits, including
buffer overflows, Structured Query Language (SQL) injection attacks, cross-site scripting, crosssite
request forgery, and click-jacking of code to gain control over vulnerable machines. In
one attack, more than 1 million web servers were exploited and turned into infection engines
for visitors to those sites using SQL injection. During that attack, trusted websites from state
governments and other organizations compromised by attackers were used to infect hundreds of
thousands of browsers that accessed those websites. Many more web and non-web application
vulnerabilities are discovered on a regular basis.

for internally developed software.
Establish a process to accept and address reports
of software vulnerabilities, including providing
a means for external entities to contact your
security group.
Maintain separate environments for production
and non-production systems. Developers should
not have unmonitored access to production
environments.
Protect web applications by deploying web
application firewalls (WAFs) that inspect all traffic
flowing to the web application for common web
application attacks. For applications that are not
web-based, specific application firewalls should
be deployed if such tools are available for the
given application type. If the traffic is encrypted,
the device should either sit behind the encryption
or be capable of decrypting the traffic prior
to analysis. If neither option is appropriate, a
host-based web application firewall should be
deployed.
For applications that rely on a database, use
standard hardening configuration templates. All
systems that are part of critical business processes
should also be tested.
48
CIS Control 18: Procedures and Resources
The security of applications (in-house developed or acquired off the shelf or from external
developers) is a complex activity requiring a complete program encompassing enterprise-wide
policy, technology, and the role of people.
All software should be regularly tested for vulnerabilities. The operational practice of scanning
for application vulnerabilities has been consolidated within CIS Control 3: Continuous
Vulnerability Management. However, the most effective approach is to implement a full supply
chain security program for externally acquired software and a Secure Software Development Life
Cycle for internally developed software. Those aspects are addressed in this Control.
For software developed in-house or customer software developed externally under contract,
an effective program for applications software must address security throughout the entire
life-cycle, and embed security in as a natural part of establishing requirements, training, tools,
and testing. Modern development cycles and methods do not allow for sequential approaches.
Acceptance criteria should always include requirements that application vulnerability testing
tools be run and all known vulnerabilities be documented. It is safe to assume that software
will not be perfect, and so a development program must plan up-front for bug reporting and
remediation as an essential security function.
For software which is acquired (commercial, open-source, etc.), application security criteria should
be part of the evaluation criteria and efforts should be made to understand the source’s software
practices, testing, and error reporting and management. Whenever possible, suppliers should be
required to show evidence that standard commercial software testing tools or services were used
and no known vulnerabilities are present in the current version.
The actions in this Control provide specific, high-priority steps that can improve Application
Software Security. In addition, we recommend use of some of the excellent comprehensive
resources dedicated to this topic:
• The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)
OWASP is an open community that creates and shares a rich collection of
software tools and documentation on application security.

software security, integrity and authenticity practices.

Incident Response and Management
Protect the organization’s information, as well as its reputation, by developing and implementing
an incident response infrastructure (e.g., plans, defined roles, training, communications,
management oversight) for quickly discovering an attack and then effectively containing the
damage, eradicating the attacker’s presence, and restoring the integrity of the network and
systems.
Why Is This CIS Control Critical?
Cyber incidents are now just part of our way of life. Even large, well-funded, and technically
sophisticated enterprises struggle to keep up with the frequency and complexity of attacks. The
question of a successful cyber-attack against an enterprise is not “if” but “when.”
When an incident occurs, it is too late to develop the right procedures, reporting, data collection,
management responsibility, legal protocols, and communications strategy that will allow the
enterprise to successfully understand, manage, and recover. Without an incident response
plan, an organization may not discover an attack in the first place, or, if the attack is detected,
the organization may not follow good procedures to contain damage, eradicate the attacker’s
presence, and recover in a secure fashion. Thus, the attacker may have a far greater impact,
causing more damage, infecting more systems, and possibly exfiltrate more sensitive data than
would otherwise be possible were an effective incident response plan in place.

V7 51
CIS Control 19: Procedures and Tools
After defining detailed incident response procedures, the incident response team should engage
in periodic scenario-based training, working through a series of attack scenarios fine-tuned to
the threats and vulnerabilities the organization faces. These scenarios help ensure that team
members understand their role on the incident response team and also help prepare them to
handle incidents. It is inevitable that exercise and training scenarios will identify gaps in plans and
processes, and unexpected dependencies.
The actions in this Control provide specific, high-priority steps that can improve enterprise
security, and should be a part of any comprehensive incident and response plan. In addition,
we recommend use of some of the excellent comprehensive resources dedicated to this topic:

20 CIS Control 20:
Penetration Tests and Red Team Exercises
Test the overall strength of an organization’s defense (the technology, the processes, and the
people) by simulating the objectives and actions of an attacker.
Why Is This CIS Control Critical?
Attackers often exploit the gap between good defensive designs and intentions and
implementation or maintenance. Examples include: the time window between announcement of
a vulnerability, the availability of a vendor patch, and actual installation on every machine. Other
examples include: well-intentioned policies that have no enforcement mechanism (especially
those intended to restrict risky human actions); failure to apply good configurations to machines
that come on and off of the network; and failure to understand the interaction among multiple
defensive tools, or with normal system operations that have security implications.
A successful defensive posture requires a comprehensive program of effective policies and
governance, strong technical defenses, and appropriate action by people. In a complex
environment where technology is constantly evolving, and new attacker tradecraft appears
regularly, organizations should periodically test their defenses to identify gaps and to assess their
readiness by conducting penetration testing.
Penetration testing starts with the identification and assessment of vulnerabilities that can be
identified in the enterprise. Next, tests are designed and executed to demonstrate specifically
how an adversary can either subvert the organization’s security goals (e.g., the protection of
specific Intellectual Property) or achieve specific adversarial objectives (e.g., establishment of
a covert Command and Control infrastructure). The results provide deeper insight, through
demonstration, into the business risks of various vulnerabilities.
Red Team exercises take a comprehensive approach at the full spectrum of organization policies,
processes, and defenses in order to improve organizational readiness, improve training for
defensive practitioners, and inspect current performance levels. Independent Red Teams can
provide valuable and objective insights about the existence of vulnerabilities and the efficacy
of defenses and mitigating controls already in place and even of those planned for future
implementation.

environment for specific penetration tests and
Red Team attacks against elements that are not
typically tested in production, such as attacks
against supervisory control and data acquisition
and other control systems.
Use vulnerability scanning and penetration
testing tools in concert. The results of
vulnerability scanning assessments should be used
as a starting point to guide and focus penetration
testing efforts.
Wherever possible, ensure that Red Team results
are documented using open, machine-readable
standards (e.g., SCAP). Devise a scoring method
for determining the results of Red Team exercises
so that results can be compared over time.
Any user or system accounts used to perform
penetration testing should be controlled and
monitored to make sure they are only being used
for legitimate purposes, and are removed or
restored to normal function after testing is over.
54
CIS Control 20: Procedures and Resources
Historically, penetration tests and Red Team tests are performed:
• as a “dramatic” demonstration of an attack, usually to convince decisionmakers
of their enterprise’s vulnerability;
• as a means to test the correct operation of enterprise defenses
(“verification”); and
• to test that the enterprise has built the right defenses in the first place
(“validation”).
In general, these kinds of tests are expensive, complex, and potentially introduce their own risks.
They can provide significant value, but only when basic defensive measures are already in place,
and when these tests are performed as part of a comprehensive, ongoing program of security
management and improvement. Test events are a very expensive way to discover that your
enterprise does a poor job with patching and configuration management, for example.
Each organization should define a clear scope and rules of engagement for penetration testing
and Red Team analyses. The scope of such projects should include, at a minimum, systems with
the organization’s highest value information and production processing functionality. Other
lower-value systems may also be tested to see if they can be used as pivot points to compromise
higher-value targets. The rules of engagement for penetration tests and Red Team analyses
should describe, at a minimum, times of day for testing, duration of tests, and the overall test
approach.
The actions in this Control provide specific, high-priority steps that can improve enterprise
security, and should be a part of any penetration testing and Red Team program. In addition,
we recommend use of some of the excellent comprehensive resources dedicated to this topic to
